I am working on setting up Lua following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rol8n3FYtuU&ab_channel=Aqua

I am doing this so I can transcribe the code in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4nf23HywmI&ab_channel=TheMindGrid
  The code from this video is uploaded under botnet01-dissector.lua 
  feel free to experiment with it.
